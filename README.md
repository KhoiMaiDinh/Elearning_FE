AI-powered E-learning Platform (with Integrated Vietnamese ABSA)
🧠 Introduction

As education continues to shift toward online environments, the demand for flexible, high-quality, and affordable learning platforms is growing rapidly. However, existing platforms such as Udemy, Coursera, and Edumall still have notable limitations in terms of cost, content quality, and personalization capabilities.

This project aims to build a modern E-learning system that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), to analyze learner feedback. The goal is to enhance course content and improve the overall learning experience.

🎯 Objectives
General Goals

Develop an online learning platform that enables:

Instructors to create content and teach via video and documents.

Learners to study flexibly and leave course feedback.

An AI-powered system to analyze feedback and suggest improvements.

Specific Goals

Allow learners to track progress and submit detailed reviews.

Apply ABSA to extract sentiment for each course component (videos, materials, exercises).

Provide instructors with analytics to improve teaching quality.

Offer a low-cost solution with a user-friendly interface tailored for Vietnamese users.

📦 Scope
Deployment Environments

Development: Localhost for initial development and testing.

Testing/Staging: Pre-release quality assurance.

Production: Full deployment for real users.

Core Features
